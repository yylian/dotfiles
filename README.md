# dotfiles

These are my very own dotfiles. The setup script is supposed to only work on
OSX, but the asset files such as `.zshrc`, or the alacritty config, do work
cross-platform.

## Setup

Setup like this:
```
zsh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yylian/dotfiles/master/setup.sh)"
```
